<h3>Overview of Values</h3>
<p>Values are what are at the heart of an individual’s personality. They influence how you navigate through life, career and what makes you happy.

<br>
I did some research into personal values and out of interest,  

I took the <a href="https://richardstep.com/dope-test/">DOPE 4 Birds Personality Types Test</a>. This test classified and feathers me as the Owl.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Logical, mathematically minded, methodical and sometimes seen as a perfectionist. </blockquote>
<br>
<br>
I would add to that I am also see myself as efficient and can work fast to get things done but to a high standard, and compromise on perfectionism. For example when following recipes I will sometimes skip steps or ingredients to get it done. 
    
<ul>


<h3> Explain a situation a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made 
    and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
    
<p> In my previous role at a startup, we needed more data for training one of our machine learning models. 
    A suggestion was made in the wider team that we could combine client data just for the training.
     The collection and use of data is a complex and challenging area because we cannot always 
     fall back on what is agreed or legal. This topic is not necessarily black and white due to wider ethical implications. 
     In that instance I was vocal due to an internal integrous voice and discussed with my immediate team. We raise the technical and wider  privacy implications of client data. We then discussed with the wider team 
     to keep data separate in all scenarios which set a standard for ourselves as a team and company.  </p>
    
<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>

<p>My family is Dutch and some of my traits are probably quite Dutch too. I spent a lot of my childhood with my grandparents.

  There is a Dutch word for their directness: <br>
  <i>bespreekbaarheid</i> (speakability) – that everything can and should be talked about
  <br>
  I am also relatively organised person and try to be on time and schedule meetings in advance.</p> 

<h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
    
<p>My strengths are <strong>curiosity</strong> and <strong>risk taking</strong>, I am always looking out for opportunities; <strong>balanced</strong> as I can bring calm and structure to chaotic situations;
  <strong>purposeful</strong> as I enjoy keeping busy, and can <strong>problem solve</strong> even in chaotic situations.
<br>
My limitations are that I can get impatient with myself and get bored if I'm not busy. I need to work more on spending time on self care.
</p>
<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>

  <p>
    I have been able to change career to data science and teach myself to code by being curious and self motivated.
  </p>

<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
  
<p>
    Although I enjoy problem solving in coding problems, I can get frustrated if I don't solve these quickly. I realise more and more to take constant breaks and to reach out to others to get different viewpoints and feedback.  </p>

    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively 
    with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, 
    how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
    
<p>
    I have worked as a Test Manager in large IT programs. 
    I worked on a new website and mobile app project at Sovereign which involved a variety of 
    business stakeholders and internal and external technology teams. 
    The biggest tension in the project was balancing the IT security standards  with 
    producing a marketable user friendly interface. My role 
    involved understanding all project team members issues and perspectives to propose solutions 
    within the tight time frames. I used a combination of personal conversations and group meetings to achieve workable compromises. I still use these techniques in data science projects.
