      <description>IntroductionThis tutorial was inspired by the R Curious tutorial at useR! 2018, and follows on thematically from the R Curious workshop notes as an extension.
It is aimed at those with a background in Excel, who would also like to use R for data analysis. This tutorial compares the things you would normally do in Excel, but with an equivalent function in R.
This introductory level tutorial assumes you have already installed R and R studio and had a brief introduction to the R basics and R Markdown.</description>
