      <description>There are a many tutorials and the great blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown with detailed steps on how to create a website using blogdown and Hugo. I found these extremely useful in setting up this site.
I used the fantastic tutorial by Tyler Clavelle to create this blog. This blog uses blogdown R package and static site generator Hugo. I chose to use the hugo creative portfolio theme, with side bar and tiles layout.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
I started coding in March 2017 and until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to also reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.</description>
