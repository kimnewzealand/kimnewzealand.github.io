      <description>I have been updating my blogdown website with posts, and then I hit an issue. The about link would not update. I tried multiple amendments and multiple commits to no avail. I then re-created the whole website and reinstalled the theme. This still didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I finally figured out that the slug in the about.md file was about-me, and the build site saved the index.html in an about-me folder. However the corresponding HTML file was looking for a github.</description>

      <description>This blog was using the creative portfolio theme until the number of posts grew. The tiled effect became busy and the website required a different website format including an archive list.
I have changed the theme to Blackburn following this post by Mike Treglia.
So far so good&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
Until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.</description>

      <description>There are a many tutorials and the great bookdown blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown with detailed steps on how to create a website using blogdown and Hugo.
I used the fantastic tutorial by Tyler Clavelle to create this blog. This website uses the blogdown R package and static site generator Hugo. I chose to use the Hugo creative portfolio theme, with side bar and tiles layout. I use Windows and GitHub repo to deploy the website.</description>
