      <description>There are a many tutorials and the great bookdown blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown with detailed steps on how to create a website using blogdown and Hugo.
I used the fantastic tutorial by Tyler Clavelle to create this blog. This website uses the blogdown R package and static site generator Hugo. I chose to use the Hugo creative portfolio theme, with side bar and tiles layout.
This post is a brief summary of my tips (discovered through trial error and many github pushes) if you are using Windows, have installed the Hugo creative portfolio theme and using a GitHub repo to deploy your website.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
I started coding in March 2017 and until now I have been creating and publishing R Markdown to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of my projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to easily publish a portfolio of projects with detailed code and HTML output so I created this website.</description>
