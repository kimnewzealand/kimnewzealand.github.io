      <description>Background I have a background in Actuarial Science and have worked in analyst roles and project delivery in Credit Risk and Finance.
I discovered data science as a magical field that combines my statistics and analytical skills; my project and multitasking experience; a curiosity of numbers and patterns; love of learning new tools and concepts whilst working with a variety of people and teams.
Current Role I now work as an independent through Validly and am available for remote data science work.</description>
