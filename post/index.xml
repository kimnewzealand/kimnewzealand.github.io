      <description>IntroductionExploratory Data AnalysisConclusionsReferencesIntroductionRecently one of the problems I was trying to solve required matrix algebra.
This falls under the umbrella of need to know R basics so I realised I needed a way to track and refresh my R skills, recognise gaps and ultimately create a reference cheat-sheet.

      <description>One of the things to reconcile with working in a field is that what interests you and what you need to create or provide as a service commercially is not always the same thing.
If doing only one then itâ€™s like throwing one ball - it is quite doable but monotonous.
Personal projectsPublishing personal side projects as blogs is great practice and ongoing personal learning. I use these to improve the efficiency of my end to end workflow and also to try out different tools, packages and functionality.</description>

Since it was a close game I wondered if the type of shots attempted got closer to the hoop under pressure near the end of time, assuming that shorter range shots have a better success rate ?</description>

      <description>This post is of the the folder structure of a blogdown website, to get a basic understanding of how it works and to also remind myself next time I face a similar publishing issue!
Publishing issue I have been updating my blogdown website with posts, and then I hit an issue. The about link would not update. I tried multiple amendments and multiple commits to no avail. I then re-created the whole website and reinstalled the theme.</description>

      <description>This blog was using the creative portfolio theme until the number of posts grew. The tiled effect became busy and the website required a different website format including an archive list.
I have changed the theme to Blackburn following this post by Mike Treglia.
So far so good&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis tutorial was inspired by the R Curious tutorial at useR! 2018, and follows on thematically from the R Curious workshop notes as an extension.
It is aimed at those with a background in Excel, who would also like to use R for data analysis. This tutorial compares the things you would normally do in Excel, but with an equivalent function in R.
This introductory level tutorial assumes you have already installed R and R studio and had a brief introduction to the R basics and R Markdown.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been working on an Natural Language Processing (NLP) client project. This field appears to extensively use Python packages so I used the opportunity to go on an NLP journey in Python, starting with a Jupyter notebook. The Python packages included here are the research tool NLTK, gensim then the more recent spaCy.
The purpose of this post is the next step in the journey to produce a pipeline for the NLP areas of text mining and Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Python spaCy NLP Toolkit, in R.</description>

      <description>Version control of code seems similar to creating, updating and sharing recipes. Since we were trying out crepe recipes at home, I decided to use this personal connection to work through a crepes made with git example to validate my understanding of Git from the command line.
Inspired by Reflections on 4 months of GitHub: my advice to beginners by Suzan Baert, I also started a personal Git cheatsheet, which will be incrementally updated with gems from future projects.</description>

      <description>I have been experimenting with spatial data and looking at ways to combine data objects to get different views and perspectives. This post has the following objectives:
Import and load data direct to R without manually saving files to a local directory, so that the end to end process is reproducible.Use vectors to efficiently clean the Excel sheet, reducing manual steps where possible so that the process could be leveraged to clean other Excel sheets in the Census data.</description>

      <title>Simple Blockchain Example in R</title>

      <description>This R markdown post was inspired by the R-bloggers post Building your own blockchain in R.
Blockchain technology, types such as bitcoin and ethereum and its associated terminology are ubiquitous in the media at the moment.
The objective here is to learn how a generic blockchain works and understand some of the terminology through implementing a simple example. This generic example could then extended to various types of blockchains such as distributed ledgers, smart contracts or cryptocurrencies with network servers and appropriate privacy and security settings.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
Until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.</description>

      <description>There are a many tutorials and the great bookdown blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown with detailed steps on how to create a website using blogdown and Hugo.
I used the fantastic tutorial by Tyler Clavelle to create this blog. This website uses the blogdown R package and static site generator Hugo. I chose to use the Hugo creative portfolio theme, with side bar and tiles layout. I use Windows and GitHub repo to deploy the website.</description>
