This theme does not seem to accept list.html in layout.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
I started coding in March 2017 and until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to also reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.</description>
