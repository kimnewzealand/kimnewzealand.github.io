      <description>There are a many tutorials and the great bookdown blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown with detailed steps on how to create a website using blogdown and Hugo.
I used the fantastic tutorial by Tyler Clavelle to create this blog. This website uses the blogdown R package and static site generator Hugo. I chose to use the Hugo creative portfolio theme, with side bar and tiles layout. I use Windows and GitHub repo to deploy the website.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
Until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.</description>

SynopsisThis R markdown post was inspired by the R-bloggers post Building your own blockchain in R.
Blockchain technology, types such as bitcoin and ethereum and its associated terminology are ubiquitous in the media at the moment.
The objective here is to learn how a generic blockchain works and understand some of the terminology through implementing a simple example.</description>

      <description>SynopsisOn 13th December 2017 I attended a day of the IASC-ARS/68th Annual NZSA Conference. I attended a talk by Rob Hyndman on Probabilistic Outlier Detection And Visualization Of Smart Meter Data.
Inspired by Rob Hyndman’s talk, I decided to perform an exploratory data analysis of smart meter data. There are a variety of open energy data resources. This analysis will use ErNOC green button open data set.</description>
