      <description>SynopsisOn 13th December 2017 I attended a day of the IASC-ARS/68th Annual NZSA Conference. I attended a talk by Rob Hyndman on Probabilistic Outlier Detection And Visualization Of Smart Meter Data.
Inspired by Rob Hyndmanâ€™s talk, I decided to perform an exploratory data analysis of smart meter data. There are a variety of open energy data resources.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.
I started coding in March 2017 and until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress professional website to also reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.</description>
